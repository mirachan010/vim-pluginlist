This is a Vim plugin to show a christmas tree in Vim.

```
:MerryChristmas
```

The ascii art was prepared based on [Laura T's art](https://www.asciiart.eu/holiday-and-events/christmas/trees).

This plugin was created for [my Japanese blog post](https://rhysd.hatenablog.com/entry/2018/12/23/235933) for [Vim Advent Calendar 2018](https://qiita.com/advent-calendar/2018/vim).
