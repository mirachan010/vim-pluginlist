## Completes Keyword Argments in Ruby

This is a source of neocomplcache which completes keyword argments in Ruby.
Keyword arguments are available in Ruby 2.0 or later.
Keyword arguments allow us to forget the order of the arguments.
However, we must remember the name of arguments (although this is
far easy in contrast to the order of them).
This plugin completes the name of arguments using neocomplcache.
`[K]` in menu items are the mark of keysord-argument-complete.

In a following example, argument name `tsura` of the method `test` is completing.

![complete a first keyword argument, 'tsura'](https://raw.github.com/rhysd/neco-ruby-keyword-args/master/screenshot.jpg)

This source now can completes keyword arguments of the methods from
- the buffer you are editting
- files required in your buffer recursively

[neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache) is required.
