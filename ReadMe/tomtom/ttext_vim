This plugin aims at facilitating editing text files with long lines.

Features:

- Set 'textwidth' to 0 if the current buffer contains long lines (see 
  `g:ttext_detect_tw_pattern`)
- Remap some movement keys if 'textwidth' is 0 (see 
  `g:ttext_handle_tw0_pattern`)
- Enable some minimal highlighting for some filetypes (see 
  `g:ttext_highlight_filetype_rx`)
