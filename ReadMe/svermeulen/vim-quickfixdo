Quick Fix Do
========

This Vim plugin adds the ability to perform a command for every file in the quickfix list in the same way :bufdo allows you to perform a command for each buffer.  I think it was based on some code I found at vim.org.  This is very useful after performing 'ack' for some text that you then want to replace.

Note: Supports using 'c' in subsitute commands as well

Example:

    :Qfdo %s/foo/bar/c
