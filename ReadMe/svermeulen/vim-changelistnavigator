vim-changelistnavigator
=======================

This Vim plugin makes the following changes to the behaviour of `g;` and `g,`:

* Only navigate forward/backwards in the change list if the cursor is on the current change list item, and otherwise goes to that item.
* If going forward/backward does not change the current line then continue going forward/backward until it does
