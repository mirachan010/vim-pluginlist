An pseudo `EDITOR` to open a file in a working Vim/Neovim instead of a new one.
It has no external dependencies.

**This is in alpha stabe. Anything will be drastically changed without announcement.**

## Usage

Open `:terminal` and execute applications which use `$EDITOR` internally.
For example, `git commit` uses `$EDITOR` in default.

Note that `$EDITOR` includes arguments so you need to use `eval` to execute it directly like:

```
$ eval $EDITOR {filename}
```
