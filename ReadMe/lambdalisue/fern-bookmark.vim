A plugin for [fern.vim](https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern.vim) which provides simple bookmark feature.

## Usage

First of all, open fern for any scheme and hit `B` to save selected nodes to bookmarks.
Then, execute the following command to open a bookmark tree.

```
:Fern bookmark:///
```

In bookmark tree, you can manually create a new bookmark with `N` or edit with `e`.
Or, hit `<Return>` to open the bookmark, `x` to open the bookmark with a system
program, or execute `cd/lcd/tcd` action to change current directory.
