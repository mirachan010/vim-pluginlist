# vim-operator-breakline

Like `gq` but break a line even on words.

## Usage

This plugin does not provide actual mappings so define these by yourself like:

```vim
" The following mappings use the value of 'textwidth'
nmap <C-g>q <Plug>(operator-breakline-textwidth)
xmap <C-g>q <Plug>(operator-breakline-textwidth)

" The following mappings shows prompt to ask the value
nmap <C-g>Q <Plug>(operator-breakline-manual)
xmap <C-g>Q <Plug>(operator-breakline-manual)
```

_Note: this plugin silently fails when the target text is shorter than the length you've specified._
