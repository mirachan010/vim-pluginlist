# ncm2-neoinclude

ncm2-neoinclude is source for [NCM2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2), it depends on [Shougo/neoinclude.vim](https://github.com/shougo/neoinclude.vim)

neoinclude provides `include` completion for neocomplete, deoplete, and ncm1

For C, when you type `#include <`, it will show the header file candidates.
For Python, when you type `import xx`, it will show the import candidates.
neoinclude also supports some other languages.

This plugin is a wrap for neoinclude to support ncm2.
