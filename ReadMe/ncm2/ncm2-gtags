# ncm2-gtags

ncm2-gtags is gtags source for [NCM2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2)

This plugin is split from [gen_tags.vim](https://github.com/jsfaint/gen_tags.vim).  
Because some user don't use [gen_tags.vim](https://github.com/jsfaint/gen_tags.vim) or [NCM2](https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2) in same time.

:warning: the `global` command and `GTAGS` file is needed.

:information_source: It is strong recommended to work with [gen_tags.vim](https://github.com/jsfaint/gen_tags.vim) which will generate and update `GTAGS` for you.

## Installation

Assuming that you are using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'ncm2/ncm2-gtags'
```
