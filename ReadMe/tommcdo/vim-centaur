centaur.vim
===========

Centaur.vim defines a Vim operator to vertically center the block of
lines defined by a motion command on the screen. That is, the matching
lines will be scrolled nicely into view.

For example, to vertically center a paragraph, you'd type `gzip` (`gz`
for the operator, and `ip` for "inner paragraph").

When the block of lines defined by the motion command is larger than
the viewport, the first line of the block is scrolled to the top of the
viewport.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tommcdo/vim-centaur.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help centaur`.
