line6.vim
=========

Determine wheteher your cursor is on line 6 in the current buffer.

Usage
-----

Run the command `:AmIOnLineSix` anywhere in the buffer. If your cursor is on
line 6, it will display "Yes". If it is not on line 6, it will display "No".

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-line6.git

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help line6`.

Contributing
------------

This plugin is a lot of work and can't be taken on by just one developer, so
contributions are welcome. All pull requests will be merged without question.
