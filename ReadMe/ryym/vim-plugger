# vim-plugger

My plugin manager for Vim.

- One configuration file per one plugin
    - It makes plugin management easy and scalable.
- Allow to define before/after load hook
    - It is important that we can define them in a one place per plugin.
- Use Vim's package system
    - Put all plugins in the '/opt' directory for easy enabling/disabling.

I extracted this from my dotfiles (<https://github.com/ryym/dotfiles/pull/2>).
