# vim-auto-programming

vim-auto-programming provides statistical whole lines completions for git projects.
It's inspired by [hitode909/atom-auto-programming](https://github.com/hitode909/atom-auto-programming).

It's like `i_CTRL-X_CTRL-L` and `i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K` but powered by `git grep`.

## How To Use

```vim
set completefunc=autoprogramming#complete
```

Write some code and run `<C-x><C-u>` or something to invoke `autoprogramming#complete` manually.
You will get candidates of next line of the code.

For example, when you type `impo`, the code you want to get is `import (`, and you might want to insert next line as `"fmt"`.

## Requirements
- Only git projects are supported.
