## vim-textobj-function-syntax - heuristic syntax-based text-object for function

vim-textobj-function-syntax provides heuristic text-objects for function by
using syntax definitions.

This plugin extends
[kana/vim-textobj-function](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function)
plugin and provides syntax-based text-object for function. It doesn't overwide
filetype specific text-object for function, so you can use
vim-textobj-function-syntax as a fallback.

Requirements:
- Vim 8.0 or later
- https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-function 0.1.0 or later

### Credit
It's inspired by the
[t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus](https://github.com/t9md/atom-vim-mode-plus)
implementation of text-object for function.
