This is the Vim client for [TabNine](https://tabnine.com), the all-language autocompleter.

- Indexes your whole project, reading your .gitignore to determine which files to index.
- Type long variable names in just a few keystrokes using the mnemonic completion engine.
- Zero configuration. TabNine works out of the box.
- Highly responsive: typically produces a list of suggestions in less than 10 milliseconds.

The Vim client for TabNine is adapted from [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe).
