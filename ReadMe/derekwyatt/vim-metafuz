vim-metafuz
===========

This plugin is pretty damn simple.  It's just an extraction of a couple of
commands from my vimrc file.  When working with certain code trees, it's nice to
use [fuzzyfinder](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984), but
it's a bit tough from time to time.  Keeping the fuzzyfinder cache hot and
finding the right "project root" is a pain.  These things make it easier.
