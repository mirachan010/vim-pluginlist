===========

The "Tag Explorer" plugin provides the following features:

1. Opens a vertically/horizontally split Vim window with a list of files in
   a directory. You can list all the tags (functions, classes, structures,
   variables, etc) defined in a file. You can jump to the location where a
   tag is defined. You can edit a selected file. You can browse through the
   directories.
2. Groups the tags by their type and displays them in a foldable tree.
3. When a tag name is selected from the explorer window, positions the cursor
   at the definition of the tag in the source file
4. Can display the prototype of a tag from the tag explorer window.
5. Displays the scope of a tag.
6. The displayed tags can be sorted either by name or by line number.
7. Supports the following programming language files: Assembly, ASP, Awk, C,
   C++, Cobol, Eiffel, Fortran, Java, Lisp, Make, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python,
   Rexx, Ruby, Scheme, Shell, Slang, Sql, TCL, Verilog, Vim and Yacc.
8. Runs in all the platforms where the exuberant ctags utility and Vim are
   supported (this includes MS-Windows and Unix based systems).
9. Runs in both console/terminal and GUI versions of Vim.

This plugin relies on the exuberant ctags utility to generate the tag
listing. You can download the exuberant ctags utility from
http://ctags.sourceforge.net. The exuberant ctags utility must be installed
in your system to use this plugin. Exuberant ctags version 5.3 and above is
recommended.  There is no need for you to create a tags file to use this
plugin.
