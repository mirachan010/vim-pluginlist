The Vim tree control plugin provides support for creating and using a tree
control in a Vim window. The tree control can be used by Vim plugins to
present information in a tree form to the user and is suited for displaying
information that is hierarchical in nature. The tree control manages the tree,
the associated window and the buffer.

Some examples for the plugins that will benefit from using the tree control
are file manager, buffer explorer, tags explorer, Favorites, Most Recently
Used (MRU) files, etc.
