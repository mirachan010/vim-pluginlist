Vim plugin to search and replace a pattern across multiple files interactively.

The Global Replace plugin allows you to search and replace a pattern across
multiple files. The lines containing a specified pattern in multiple files are
displayed in a Vim buffer. You can then edit the lines in this buffer and make
the desired modifications to them. After making the modifications, by running a
command you can then incorporate these changes back into the corresponding
files interactively.
