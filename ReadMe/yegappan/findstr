Findstr Vim Plugin
==================

The findstr.vim plugin integrates the MS-Windows findstr search utility with
Vim. You can use this plugin to search for a pattern or text in multiple
files in the current directory or in a directory tree and easily jump to the
matches. This plugin is useful only in MS-Windows based systems where the
findstr utility is available.
