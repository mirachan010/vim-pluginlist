# Description

Vim plugin for manipulating FASTA file contents.

I am working on this plugin so its functionality may grow, or it may stagnate.
Who knows.

The only functionality so far are the commands `:FastaReverseComplement` and
`:FastaSearch`.  The former reverse complements the nucleotides in the
specified line range (or the current line if no range is specified), and the
latter can be used to search for sequences (e.g. `AAgNnwcR`).

All functionality is aware of the IUPAC nucleotide code set:

    A      Adenine
    C      Cytosine
    G      Guanine
    T      Thymine
    R      A or G
    Y      C or T
    S      G or C
    W      A or T
    K      G or T
    M      A or C
    B      C or G or T
    D      A or G or T
    H      A or C or T
    V      A or C or G
    N      any base



# Installation

Assuming you are using the [Pathogen plugin][pathogen], just clone this
repository in your `~/.vim/bundle` folder like so:

```
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/b4winckler/vim-fasta.git
```

Alternatively, you can just put the [`fasta.vim` script][plugin] in your
`~/.vim/plugin` folder (create the folder if it does not already exist).
