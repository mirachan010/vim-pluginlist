Hex editor in Vim.
==================

`vim -b file.dat` to edit file in hex mode.

Pretty much the same as https://github.com/fidian/hexmode.

`fidian/hexmode` used to autodetect binary files and it was very annoying, so
I forked it and removed the autodetection feature.

I had this in my `.vimrc` for a few years. Time to split it out.
