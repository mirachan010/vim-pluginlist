Inspired by [TrumpScript](http://samshadwell.me/TrumpScript/)

You must write text with following rules.

* No floating point numbers, only integers. America never does anything halfway.
* All numbers must be strictly greater than 1 million. The small stuff is inconsequential to us.
* There are no import statements allowed. Don't use `:r` command.
* Instead of True and False, we have fact and lie.

America is Great
