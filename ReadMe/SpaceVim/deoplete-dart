# deoplete-dart

Dart source for [deoplete.nvim](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) using [analysis_server](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analysis_server).

## Overview
Asynchronous Dart completion for Neovim. This is based on the work done for YCM support in [cbracken/ycmd](https://github.com/cbracken/ycmd) with [zchee/deoplete-go](https://github.com/zchee/deoplete-go) used as an example deoplete source.

This is a very simplistic implementation with basically no error checking and only the most basic completion pulled out of the analysis server. **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
