# zenn-vim

(!Alpha) plugin for zenn.dev

## Required

- vim or neovim
  - can call async command if you use neovim
- npm
  - zenn official doesn't specify nodejs version number, but I recommend using
    its latest lts version.

## Features

- Add functions like `zenn_vim#init()`, `zenn_vim#new_article()`, ...
- No keybinds and commands.

For details, see [`doc/zenn_vim.txt`](https://github.com/kkiyama117/zenn-vim/blob/master/doc/zenn_vim.txt)
or call `:help zenn_vim` on vim
