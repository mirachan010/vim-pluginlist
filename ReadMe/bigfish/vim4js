# Vim4JS -- Vim for Javascript

A collection of plugins, and settings for effective Javascript editing in Vim.

## Requirements

### [nodelint](https://github.com/tav/nodelint)

Installation (after Node.js, and NPM have been installed):

    sudo npm install -g nodelint@0.5.2

### [vim-nodelint](https://github.com/bigfish/vim-nodelint)

This is a separate vim compiler plugin I wrote.
I recommend you use pathogen to install this into your bundle/ directory.
Or you can install it manually.

## Features

### Filetype settings

Included in `after/ftplugin/javascript.vim`.

Sets tabwidth to 4, and always expands tabs to spaces. 

Also adds a couple of keymaps (in .js files only): 
  
  - Shift + Enter  --> addds semicolon to end of line
  - Ctrl + Shift + Enter --> adds a comma at the end of the line

Also sets the compiler to 'nodelint' (uses the vim-nodelint plugin)

### Better Javascript Syntax

Includes [this javascript syntax](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1491),
with a minor tweak to allow folding on {} and [] blocks, as well as functions. use 'zc' to close,
and 'zo' to open folds.

### Indentation

Includes the [web-indent](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3081) plugin.

This allows you to use the builtin indent commands (essentially '=' in command mode,
combined with a motion, eg. 'gg=G' for the whole file, or just select some text
in visual mode and hit '=').

### JSON Support

The filetype settings apply the same settings to JSON as Javascript, meaning that you can

* run jslint on the JSON on save
* fold on {}, [] 
* do indenting using =

Note that the jslint is JSON specific: it knows the content is JSON and will enforce JSON-isms, like requiring
double-quoted keys.

### JS-Taglist (optional addon)

Not included, but recommended, are my customized versions of exuberant-ctags, and taglist:

* [ctags_actionscript](git@github.com:bigfish/ctags_actionscript.git)
* [js-taglist](git@github.com:bigfish/js-taglist.git)

To install, clone the ctags_actionscript repo somewhere (not in your vim bundle dir), cd into it, and do:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

Then clone the js-taglist repo into your vim bundle dir (if using pathogen), or copy the plugin.

In my .vimrc I have

    nnoremap <silent><A-t> :TlistToggle<CR>

Which will open/close the taglist.
