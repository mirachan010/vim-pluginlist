## JS-Taglist

This is the good old [taglist](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273) vim plugin, with some hacks applied to make it work better with JavaScript.

### Instructions
Install and use the taglist.vim file exactly as you would the original plugin... ie. put it in your .vim/plugin/ folder.

### NB! Requires a custom build of Exuberant CTags

I had to modify the JavaScript parser in Exuberant CTags to get it to work with modern Javascript.

The modified ctags source code is in the [ctags actionscript](https://github.com/bigfish/ctags_actionscript) repo. 

So you'll need to clone that repo and build it yourself as follows:

    cd ctags_actionscript
    cd ctags-5.8
    make clean
    make
    sudo make install

The modifications make the parser very tolerant, which means all symbols are found 
except perhaps multiple variable declarations on one line... try to avoid that for best results.

This means its not really very well suited for generating tags files, but is well suited to the modified taglist plugin
which is included.
