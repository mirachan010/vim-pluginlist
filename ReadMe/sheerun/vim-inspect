# vim-inspect

This is WORK IN PROGRESS, any help is appreciated!

Implements communication of Vim with `node --inspect` debugger through Chrome DevTools debugging protocol:

https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/v8/


Vim communicates with debugging server through websocket protocol:

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455

## Status

Connects to server but I'm unable to receive any message. After I manage to get response I need to figure out how to unmask response payload and convert it to string... Any help would be appreciated to create working proof of concept.

## Requirements

Only Vim 8, no python is used.

## Testing

```
:Inspect node test.js
```
