# vim8-colorschemes

This repository contains updated versions of Vim color schemes. This is meant to
be a temporary repository, to stay alive as long as either (a) these color
schemes are approved for inclusion in Vim or (b) these changes are rejected.

These are the main changes:

- all color schemes pass Vim's own validation
	(`$VIMRUNTIME/colors/tools/check_colors.vim`).

- all color schemes have a uniform, consistent, structure.

- all color schemes are `termguicolors`-aware.

- RGB color names follow the capitalization in `$VIMRUNTIME/rgb.txt`.

- Issues such as those described at
	https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/22krs1/using_set_backgrounddark_in_vim_resets_the/
	or
	https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vim_dev/afPqwAFNdrU/nqh6tOM87QUJ and
	https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/1740 are taken care of.

- All color schemes define `g:terminal_ansi_colors` (currently using a standard
	palette).

- Minor inconsistencies, such as trailing spaces and mixed tab have been ironed
	out.

Other than that, the color schemes should be functionally equivalent to their
original counterpart (modulo any oversight on my part). Please review!
