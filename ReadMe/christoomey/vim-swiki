# Vim Simple Wiki (Swiki)

Swiki is a simple plugin for managing a plain text wiki.


Want to create a simple wiki vim plugin to replace vim wiki

- <enter> to create/follow a link
- with visual selected, replace spaces with dash then wiki link (no spaces in file names!)
- diary file sections for each entry. Map to create new entry. Pretend to file with time & date stamp and upper section line '-'\*78

All files should be markdown. No need to create our own syntax. Store in Dropbox?

Additional syntax highlighting for wiki links => [[Link-Text]]

Want visibility of how often a file changes. Git can do this, but is heavyweight. Dropbox not quite the same. Hook into buff write post and increment index file with counter?

Provide commands to manage wiki

- orphaned pages
- list pages by link count
- list pages by edit count
- list pages by last edit date
- list pages by modified date
- list pages by create date

This plugin is heavily inspired by the[vimwiki][]
