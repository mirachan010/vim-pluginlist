# MagicTags

MagicTags is a [Vim][] plugin that automates ctags generation for projects
using git.

MagicTags is similar to the [AutoTag][] plugin, but is simpler in its
implementation and most notably uses native vimscript.

The MagicTags plugin hooks into the save action and will attempt to update
the project's tags file for the file being saved. The key feature is that it
performs an incremental update of the tags file. Although ctags has the ability
to perform this sort of incremental update, it does not clear out old tags.
This is where MagicTags comes in: it will both remove old tags and update
new tags, automatically, as you save.

Magictags only auto-updates when it detects it's in a git repository.  It saves
the tags file in your repository root: you should add `tags` to your
.gitignore.

## Installation

MagicTags expects an up-to-date [exuberant ctags][]. The version of ctags that
comes with OS X is insufficient, use `brew install ctags` to install a working
version. Linux and BSD users should be able to install exuberant-ctags via
their respective package managers.

The easiest way to install MagicTags is to use [Pathogen][], [Vundle][] or
similar plugin management option to add it to Vim's runtime path.

For **Vundle**, add the following line to your vimrc:

``` vim
Bundle 'thoughtbot/vim-magictags'
```

Then from within Vim run the `:BundleInstall` command and Vundle will take care
of the rest.

For **Pathogen**, run the following commands in your shell:

``` bash
cd ~/.vim
mkdir -p bundle # creates bundle directory if it doesn't exist
cd bundle
git clone https://github.com/thoughtbot/vim-magictags.git
```

## Known Issues

### Repository changes outside of vim

If the contents of your repository change outside of vim, MagicTags won't know
and will not update your tags file. This is because MagicTags hooks into vim's
save action and has no knowledge of changes that happen outside vim.

The kinds of changes that will cause your tags file to get out of date include:

* git pull / rebase / rm / checkout,
* File adds/deletes/modifications from the shell,
* Initializers (or other code generators) that create new files,
* Or any other action that effect the contents of your repository outside of
  vim.

If you change repository contents outside of vim, use the
`:MagictagsInitTagsFile` command inside vim to regenerate your tags file.
