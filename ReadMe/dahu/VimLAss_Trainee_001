# VimLAss_Trainee_001

_Establish a working VimL Dev environment_

**Tasks:**

1. Install https://github.com/vim-scripts/runVimTests.git and follow the
   install instructions detailed at
   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2565

2. Install version 0.3 of
   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2213. NOTE: the 0.4
   version is currently incompatible with runVimTests.

3. Install the runVimTests binaries to a directory that's in your $PATH. I have ~/.vim/bin in my $PATH, so I would run:

  ./bin/install-rvt-binaries ~/.vim/bin

4. Test the runVimTests installation by running the successful.suite:

  runVimTests.sh ~/.vim/bundle/runVimTests/tests/runVimTests/successful.suite

You should see:

  9 files with 19 tests; 0 skipped, 19 run: 19 OK, 0 failures, 0 errors.

5. Run the test suite for this plugin:

  runVimTests.sh test/test_001.vim
