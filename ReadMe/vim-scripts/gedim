gedim
=====

My portable computer is my primary workstation. I either use an external, high
resolution monitor or its built-in screen, depending on where I am. I often use
also someone else's monitors, when I'm working remotely. This forces me to
change the graphical Vim editor dimensions for every location where I happen to
be. Though not complicated, it's annoying. That's why I wrote this script/Vim
auto-command that does the job instead. Just define the desired editor columns
and lines for a given resolution, and MacVim will open at that size every time 
that the same resolution is detected.

Features:

* User configurable: add as many output device resolutions and editor sizes as desired or needed
* MacVim and gVim compatible
* Works on OS X, Linux/Gnome, Linux/KDE, and Windows
* Unobtrusive; set it up once and forget about it

No more dragging the window corners to resize. No more :set columns=128. Just open Vim and get to work!

Caveat Fenestrae emptor:
------------------------
Unfortunately the developers or testers had only limited access to a Windows
machine.  Please let me know if you had issues using the URL in the next
section.

*Update 30.Sep.2014:*  a user reported bugs in Windows Vista - users are
advised to use gVim (or equivalent) for Windows only on versions 7 and older
(Window 8.1 is best at the time of this report).
