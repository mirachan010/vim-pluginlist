## How to install

Vison requires the following:

* git command

And, installation of the following Vim plugin is recommended:

* [Shougo/unite.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim)

If you use [NeoBundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim) for Vim plugins management, append the following to your `.vimrc`:

```vim
NeoBundle 'Shougo/unite.vim'
NeoBundle 'Quramy/vison'
```

And exec `:NeoBundleInstall`.

After installation, **execute `:VisonSetup` command**.
So, vison fetches schema file from [JSON Schema Store](http://schemastore.org/json/).
You don't need exec this command at the next Vim launch.

## Usage

### Apply schema with command
To use omni-completion, you can call the `:Vison` command on the current buffer.

For example, writing package.json(NPM configuration file) call `:Vison package.json`

If your current buffer's basename is equal to the schema name, you can ommit the argument of this command.

Once a schema file is applied, you can complete keys or values in the current buffer with omni-completion(type `<Ctrl-x><Ctrl-o>`).

You can also configure your `.vimrc` for auto applying schema with `autocmd`.
For example:

```vim
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile package.json Vison
autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile .bowerrc Vison bowerrc.json
```

### Apply schema with Unite
If you have installed [Unite](https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim), you can get a list of stored schema using `:Unite vison`.

And select a candidate, the selected schema apply to the current buffer.

### Register schema files
Open some JSON schema file in Vim and exec `:VisonRegisterSchema`.
Then, the schema file is registered into the vison.

By the default, the schema file is copied into the `~/.cache/vison/default` directory.

This command regards the basename of the current buffer as the schema name.
If the basename is `package.json` then the schema name is also `package.json`.

To set schema name explicitly, call this command with the argument.

For example `:VisonRegisterSchema npm-package`.

### Customize completion
You can configure completion with the `completeopt` option.

If you don't want the popup menu:

```vim
autocmd FileType json setlocal completeopt-=menu
```

If you want to show more informations in the preview window when completion:

```vim
autocmd FileType json setlocal completeopt+=menu,preview
```
