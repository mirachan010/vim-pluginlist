# asm2d

asm2d-vim is a lightweight Vim plugin to add syntax highlighting to assembly
files for the [asm2d](http://tapichu.github.com/asm2d/) assembler and to
[MIF](http://quartushelp.altera.com/9.1/mergedProjects/reference/glossary/def_mif.htm)
files.  It also configures the program used by the `:make` command.
