An effort to create a better editing experience for Vim on Windows.<br>
Supports fullscreen while taking care to fix visual glitches seen in
other plugins.

Put the following in your .vimrc and enjoy!
```VimL
autocmd GUIEnter * silent! WToggleClean
```

### Commands
`:WCenter {scale}`
  - Centers the window on the current monitor.  If scale is non-zero, resizes<br>
    the window as a percentage (scale / 100) of the current monitor size.

`:WSetAlpha {alpha}`
  - Sets the alpha of the window to the given value.

`:WToggleFullscreen`
  - Toggles full-screen support.

`:WToggleClean`
