# vim-vagrant

This plugin adds a `:Vagrant` command that runs vagrant, with tab
completion of subcommands. It also sets up Vagrantfiles to be highlighted
as Ruby.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/markcornick/vim-vagrant.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.

VimL by reading @tpope's code, so thanks to him.
