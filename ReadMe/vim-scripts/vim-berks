# vim-berks

This plugin adds a `:Berks` command that runs berkshelf, with tab
completion of subcommands. It also sets up Berksfiles to be highlighted
as Ruby.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/markcornick/vim-berks.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
