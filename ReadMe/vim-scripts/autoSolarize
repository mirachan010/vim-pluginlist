#Auto Solarized

This will change your vim colour scheme to either solarized dark or light
depending on the time of day.

    { 07:00 < time < 17:00 } = light

    { 07:00 > time > 17:00 } = dark

Pull requests welcome!

## Installation

[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) is probably your best bet and
what is recommended.

    autocmd VimEnter * call AutoSetSolarized()
