vim-wakatime
============

Fully automatic time tracking for Vim.


Installation
------------

Heads Up! WakaTime depends on [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/) being installed to work correctly.

1. Get an api key from: https://wakati.me

2. Using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), the Vim plugin manager:

  a) Add `Bundle 'wakatime/vim-wakatime'` to your `~/.vimrc`.

  b) Then inside Vim, type `:BundleInstall`.

3. You will see a prompt at the bottom asking for your [api key](https://www.wakati.me/#apikey). Enter your api key, then press `enter`.

4. Use Vim and your time will automatically be tracked for you.

5. Visit https://wakati.me to see your logged time.

6. Consider installing [BIND9](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BIND9ServerHowto#Caching_Server_configuration) to cache your repeated DNS requests: `sudo apt-get install bind9`
