# vim-kitchen

This plugin adds a `:Kitchen` command that runs test-kitchen, with tab
completion of subcommands. It is intended to be used with test-kitchen
1.x.

## Installation

With [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) just do:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/markcornick/vim-kitchen.git

If you prefer to use something besides pathogen, go ahead.
