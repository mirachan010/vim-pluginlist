**Overview**

Provides shell-like commands such as `'rm'`, `'ls'`, and so on from cmd-line.

## Description

The vim-shellutils provides shell-like commands such as `'rm'`, `'ls'`, and so on. This plugin is written in pure Vim script. This is because you can execute shell-like commands as long as you have huge Vim 7.3+. In addition, thanks to this plugin, you can execute it without exiting the Vim. If you want to make some direcotries, all you have to do is type `:Mkdir dirA dirB` from cmd-line.

## Requirement

Vim (**+Huge**) 7.3 or more

## Usage

### Ls

	:Ls[!] [{path}]
	
Show up some files in the {path} directory to cmd-line. If you want to show up all the files, including the files that begin with a dot in the {path} directory, then please put a bang. (`:Ls!`) If you omit the {path}, the current directory is specified as {path}.

### File

	:File [{path}]

Display {path} file information to cmd-line.If the {path} argument is omitted, set current buffer as {path}. The `:File` display many file information such as `'ls -l'` of shell.

	[file] rw-r--r-- 2014-08-15 17:02:58 (5KB) shellutils.txt

### Rm

	:Rm[!] [{path}]


Remove the {path} file. If the {path} argument is omitted, remove the current buffer. The `:Rm` inquires whether you really delete the {path} file. If you don't do this, then please put a bang. (`:Rm!`)

	:Cp[!] {src}... {directory}

Copy {src} to {dest}, or multiple {src}s to {directory}. Prompt whether to overwrite existing regular destination files. If you don't do this, then please put a bang. (`:Cp!`)

### Mv

	:Mv[!] {src}    {dest}
	:Mv[!] {src}... {directory}
