easytree.vim
============

easytree.vim - is a simple tree file manager for vim.
While being highly inspired by [NERDTree] it differs from it in it's approach to a file 
management and takes a more traditional vim yank/paste file copy/paste/delete approach
It's also more simpler in it's functionality and has much less features compared to other
file managers. It's goal is to be as fast and as minimalistic as possible.
Just the right tool for just the right task
