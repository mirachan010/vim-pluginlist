vim-gains-nrepl
===============

This has been intended to be a simple way to talk to nrepl from Vim. I've almost succeed - the only excess here is nREPL sessions support, but it is important - it enables ClojureScript support. See [plugin docs](doc/vim-gains-nrepl.txt) for details.

Installation
============

I would recommend Pathogen to manage your plugins. With Pathogen installation looks like:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    github clone https://github.com/shashurup/vim-gains-nrepl.git

That is it. You also need Vim => 7.4 with Python support to use this.
