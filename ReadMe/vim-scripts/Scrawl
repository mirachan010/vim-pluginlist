scrawl.vim
==========

Introduction
------------

Scrawl is a customizable scratch buffer for writing temporary notes, and for
testing small code pieces. Changes in it will be discarded when vim is quit.
This was heavily inspired by [scratch.vim](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=664)
I made this because it wasn't customizable enough.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply
copy and paste:

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/4Evergreen4/scrawl.git

Any other plugin managers should work fine as well, such as
[vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

Usage
-----

Use `:ScrawlSplit` to open scrawl in a new split.  You can then use
`:ScrawlClose` to close that split from anywhere in the tab.  If you want to
open scrawl in the current buffer, use `:ScrawlOpen`.  Then when you run
`:ScrawlClose` in that current tab, it will return to editing the previous file.
You can only have one scrawl buffer open in each tab.
