# QFEnter

QFEnter allows you to open items from Vim's quickfix or location list wherever you wish.

You can set a target window by giving it focus just before jumping to the
quickfix (or location list) window , or you can open items in new splits, vsplits, and tabs.
You can even open multiple items at once by visual selection!

A normal mode example:

    - Download this plugin and extract it in `~/.vim/`

## Usage

In the quickfix (or location list) window,

**\<Enter\>**, **\<2-LeftMouse\>**  
*Normal mode* : Open an item under cursor in the previously focused window.  
*Visual mode* : Open items in visual selection in the previously focused
                window.  As a result, the last item appears in the window.

**\<Leader\>\<Enter\>**  
*Normal mode* : Open an item under cursor in a new vertical split of the
                previously focused window.  
*Visual mode* : Open items in visual selection in a sequence of new vertical
                splits from the previously focused window.

**\<Leader\>\<Space\>**  
*Normal mode* : Open an item under cursor in a new horizontal split from the
                previously focused window.  
*Visual mode* : Open items in visual selection in a sequence of new horizontal
                splits of the previously focused window.

**\<Leader\>\<Tab\>**  
*Normal mode* : Open an item under cursor in a new tab.  
*Visual mode* : Open items in visual selection in a sequence of new tabs.
                By default, the quickfix window is automatically opened in the
                new tab to help you open other quickfix items. This behavior
                can be changed with the `g:qfenter_enable_autoquickfix` option.

You can change the key mappings in your .vimrc. The default setting is, 
```vim
let g:qfenter_open_map = ['<CR>', '<2-LeftMouse>']
let g:qfenter_vopen_map = ['<Leader><CR>']
let g:qfenter_hopen_map = ['<Leader><Space>']
let g:qfenter_topen_map = ['<Leader><Tab>']
```

If you're a [CtrlP] user, for instance, you might like these for familiarity:

```vim
let g:qfenter_vopen_map = ['<C-v>']
let g:qfenter_hopen_map = ['<C-CR>', '<C-s>', '<C-x>']
let g:qfenter_topen_map = ['<C-t>']
```

## Motivation

Vim's default means of opening items from the quickfix list are limited and
inconvenient:

- You cannot select a window in which to open a file when you press `<Enter>`:

  > Hitting the \<Enter\> key or double-clicking the mouse on a line has the
  > same effect. The file containing the error is opened **in the window above
  > the quickfix window**.
  > *â€” from `:help quickfix`* 

  It is inconsistent with other Quickfix commands like `:cnext` and `:cprev`
  which open a file in a previously focused window.

- You cannot decide where a horizontal split will be created when using `Ctrl-W
  <Enter>`, Vim always creates the new split window above the quickfix window.

- There is no command at all for 'open in a new vertical split window'.

These are confusing and bothered me every time, so I wrote a simple plugin to
make up for these weak points.  Its name comes from the most basic way to open
a file from the quickfix window -- the `<Enter>` key.
