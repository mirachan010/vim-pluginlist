# muxmate

An easy way to send shell commands to tmux from vim.

## Getting Started

`Leader + s` opens up the session select setting.

```sh
Select a tmux session
=====================
(0) session_one
(1) another_session
(2) another_session
```

Then you can choose the current session based on the number.

`Leader + sx` opens up the shell command input. For example.

```sh
Shell command: ls -al
```

## Integration With Rails

Currently I have coupled some rails commands to start.

`Leader + sf` to run the spec file.
`Leader + sl` to run the spec file's current line number.
`Leader + sS` to run all the specs.

## TODO

I was thinking about putting up snippets for different commands for
different languages, kind of like snipmate snippets.

Add docs.
