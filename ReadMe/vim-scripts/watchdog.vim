# watchdog.vim #

Statusline with comprehensive information about current vim buffer.

Depends on vim window size, watchdog will show most important information:
e.g. filename, how vim detected filetype, current line/cursor position.

If there are would be enough space to show additional information,
watchdog will show it. For instance file encoding of last modification date/time.
