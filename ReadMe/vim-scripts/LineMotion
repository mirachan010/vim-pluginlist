vim-linemotion
==============

a Vim Plug-in, move fast in linei of text.


#Introduction

LineMotion provides a simpler and fast way to move in line of text.

Only two method of movement - Lright() and Lleft() in LineMotion. When the method is triggered first, the cursor will move right/left to the middle ofthe line. And next it move a half of last distance of movement when triggered.

By default, there is no key binding. Because I konw that the default binding is suitable to my own taste, and the default binding may conflict with other plugins you may have installed. Of course, it's easy to set the key binding by which movement method is triggered, just put the following statement(ifmy taste is suitable for you) in your vimrc:

    nmap <leader>l :Lright<cr>
    nmap <leader>h :Lleft<cr>

#Installation

Decompress the tar ball you download, and put the linemotion.vim in ~/.vim/plugin/ .

Besides, LineMotion is compatible with pathogen!

#Usage example

Make sure you already put the statements in your vimrc as above.

Type `<leader>l` to move the cursor to the middle of the line. If the target you wanna move to is right of the cursor, type `<leader>l` again. Otherwise, type `<leader>h`. It's easy to use, isn't it?
