vim-togglenumber
================

Easy toggle between different number modes in vim: nonumber, absolute and relative number, 
with just one key sequence to rule it all. Most other plugins don't provide a seamless way 
to do all 3 modes at once.

Installation
------------

If you use [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), clone the repo as below:

    git clone https://github.com/tkhoa2711/vim-togglenumber.git ~/.vim/bundle/vim-togglenumber

After having you help tags regenerated, you can view the reference manual with `:help 
togglenumber`.

Usage
-----

By default, the plugin is triggered with `<Leader>n`. However you can add your own 
preferred mapping such as:

```viml
nnoremap <F6> :ToggleNumber<CR>
```

The standard numbering mode in vim is `nonumber`. You may go for other options by 
adding the following to your `.vimrc`:

```viml
set number
```

or

```viml
set relativenumber
```

Extra
-----

In case you have no idea about you `<Leader>` key, or rarely use it. I recommend giving the 
following setting a try, put this in your .vimrc:

```viml
let mapleader = "\<Space>"
```

Then, invoking the `<Space>n` key sequence would cycle through the modes effortlessly.

Requirements
------------

 - Vim 7.3 or later
