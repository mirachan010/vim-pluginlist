# NARC Snippets

Snippets Clients for [Nvim Async Reactive Complete](https://github.com/ms-jpq/narc)

## Supported Grammars

**100% of:**

- [LSP / VScode](https://github.com/microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/snippetSyntax.md)

**99% of:**

- [Snipmate](https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets)

- [Neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim)

- [UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips)

_by 99%, I mean I will be supporting the grammar which is the (mostly) superset of the S,N,U formats as formally delineated by the [EBNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) outlined [here](https://github.com/ms-jpq/narc-snippets/blob/narc/rplugin/python3/narc_snippets/parsers/snu.py)_

---

The CI is testing against over 10,000 popular snippets. As of now the pass rate is [`99.69%`](https://github.com/ms-jpq/narc-snippets/actions)

## Features

## Non-Features

- 100% compatibility

  I will only program to the public EBNF specification, not private implementation (which is usually slightly more promiscuous).

- Arbitrary code execution

  Not a good idea?

- Regex (for now)

  Handling regex matches in 3 different languages is PITA. (js/python/viml)
