# navitron.vim
A better file browser for vim.

:construction: Work in Progress :construction:

## Features
- Seamless file and directory management.
- Vim-like keybindings (`dd` deletes a file or directory, `hjkl` navigates,
  `r` renames).
- Integrates with [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) and [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (`f`/`t`).

## Future
- Add file/directory permission management.
- Bulk deletion (visual mode).
