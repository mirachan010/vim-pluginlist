## Change Log
See <a href="https://github.com/dhruvasagar/vim-audiobox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">CHANGELOG.md</a>

## Installation

There are several ways to install vim-audiobox:

1. I recommend installing <a
   href="https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim">NeoBundle</a> and then just
   add `NeoBundle 'dhruvasagar/vim-audiobox'` to your ~/.vimrc.

2. If you are using <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/vundle">Vundle</a> and
   then just add `Bundle 'dhruvasagar/vim-audiobox'` to your ~/.vimrc.

3. If you are using <a
   href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">pathogen.vim</a>, then just
   clone this repo (or add a submodule) in your bundle directory.

4. Manually (not recommended). Copy plugin/audiobox.vim to ~/.vim/plugin
   under UNIX or vimfiles/plugin under WINDOWS and restart VIM.
