manually or automatically.

* macVim [Snapshot 160](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases/tag/snapshot-160)+
* A color scheme which supports both light and dark themes, e.g., [NeoSolarized](https://github.com/icymind/NeoSolarized).

## Installation

For vim-plug, simply put the following line to your `.vimrc` as usual.
```
Plug 'L-TChen/auto-dark-mode.vim'
```

Enjoy it!
