==========

Acp-forked is a personal fork of and old version of [AutoComplPop](https://github.com/vim-scripts/AutoComplPop) by Takeshi NISHIDA.

My (hacky) modifications are:

* added JavaScript support,
* added PHP support,
* made `<up>` and `<Down>` work like `<C-p>` and `<C-n>` respectively in the popup menu,
* made `<S-Tab>` and `<Tab>` work like `<C-p>` and `<C-n>` respectively in the popup menu.

[This](https://bitbucket.org/ns9tks/vim-autocomplpop/) is the real deal.
