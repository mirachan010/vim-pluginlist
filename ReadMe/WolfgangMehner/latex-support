Preface
================================================================================

This repository is mainly for the use with plug-in managers.

Have a look at the [Screenshot Page](https://wolfgangmehner.github.io/vim-plugins/latexsupport.html).

The development happens in [WolfgangMehner/vim-plugins](https://github.com/WolfgangMehner/vim-plugins).


Preview Version
================================================================================

___This is a preview version!___

Notable new features:

- Call external tools via the command-line: `:Latex`, `:LatexCheck`,
  `:LatexMakeindex`, `:LatexBibtex`, `:LatexView`.
- Change the typesetter during runtime using `:LatexTypesetter`.
- Background processing, enable via `:LatexProcessing`.
- View errors from background processing in quickfix using `:LatexErrors`.
- Add maps for BibTeX buffers. The maps for the Comment, Text, and BibTeX
  templates now are available when editing BibTeX.

The background processing relies on the new `+job` feature, which becomes
available with a patch level of approx. `7.4.2000`.

_Please read the release notes below._

README for latex-support.vim (Version 2.0beta) / April 14 2019
================================================================================

  *  INSTALLATION
  *  RELEASE NOTES
  *  FILES
  *  ADDITIONAL TIPS
  *  CREDITS

LaTeX Support implements an LaTeX-IDE for Vim/gVim/Neovim. It has been written
to considerably speed up writing code in a consistent style. This is done by
inserting complete statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets. There are
many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort when
writing LaTeX.
See the help file latexsupport.txt for more information.

This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.3+ and Neovim 0.2.1+.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
================================================================================

A system-wide installation for all users can also be done. This will have
further effects on how the plug-in works. For a step-by-step instruction, as
well as an explanation of the other consequences, please see the help file
`doc/latexsupport.txt` or look up the documentation via:

      :help latexsupport-system-wide


(1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `latex-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/.vim/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/.vim/latex-support/templates/Templates`
   if you have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive `latex-support.zip` to `$HOME/.vim` and run

      unzip latex-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/.vim/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/.vim/doc/...
      $HOME/.vim/plugin/latex-support.vim

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/.vim/latex-support/rc` as a starting point.

(1.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map \ntw inside a LaTeX buffer
   or the menu entry:

      LaTeX -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/.vim/templates/latex.templates` to customize or add to
   your LaTeX template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.


(2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `latex-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/vimfiles/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/vimfiles/latex-support/templates/Templates`
   if you have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive `latex-support.zip` to `$HOME/vimfiles` and run

      unzip latex-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/doc/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/latex-support.vim

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the files in `$HOME/vimfiles/latex-support/rc` as a starting point.

(2.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map \ntw inside a LaTeX buffer
   or the menu entry:

      LaTeX -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',      'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',   'wm' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',       'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',   'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/vimfiles/templates/latex.templates` to customize or add to
   your LaTeX template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.


(3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and macros
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  using additional plug-ins

Actions differ for different modes. Please read the documentation:

      :help latexsupport 

Any problems? See the TROUBLESHOOTING section at the end of the help file
`doc/latexsupport.txt`.
