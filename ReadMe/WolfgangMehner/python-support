# Python Support

This is a Vim plug-in to help with writing Python scripts:

- insert templates from an extendable template library
- insert code snippets
- quickly comment the code by automatically generating function comments (_missing_)
- run Python inside Vim and use quickfix
- run syntax checking (_missing_)
- look up help (_in progress_)

It's a work in progress, largely for my own benefit, and currently undocumented.
It is modelled after [Lua Support](https://github.com/WolfgangMehner/lua-support),
so most of it's documentation also applies for Python Support.
