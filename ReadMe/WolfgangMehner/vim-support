Preface
================================================================================

This repository is mainly for the use with plug-in managers.

Have a look at the [Screenshot Page](https://wolfgangmehner.github.io/vim-plugins/vimsupport.html).

VimScript Support implements a VimScript-IDE for Vim/gVim/Neovim. It has been
written to considerably speed up writing code in a consistent style. This is
done by inserting complete statements, comments, idioms, and code snippets.
There are many additional hints and options which can improve speed and comfort
when writing VimScript. Please read the documentation.

This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.3+ and Neovim 0.2.1+.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION
================================================================================
  [sec_install]: #installation

A system-wide installation for all users can also be done. This will have
further effects on how the plug-in works. For a step-by-step instruction, as
well as an explanation of the other consequences, please see the help file
`doc/vimsupport.txt` or look up the documentation via:

      :help vimsupport-system-wide


(1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `vim-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/.vim/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/.vim/vim-support/templates/` if you
   have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive `vim-support.zip` to `$HOME/.vim` and run

      unzip vim-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/.vim/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/.vim/doc/...
      $HOME/.vim/plugin/vim-support.vim

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the file in `$HOME/.vim/vim-support/rc` as a starting point.

(1.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map \ntw inside a Vim buffer
   or the menu entry:

      Vim -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',       'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',    'WM' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',        'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',    'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/.vim/templates/vim.templates` to customize or add to your
   Vim template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation.)

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/.vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.

   Some settings are specifically for VimScript buffers and should be placed in
   the filetype plug-in. You may copy the file `vim-support/rc/vim.vim` into the
   directory `$HOME/.vim/ftplugin/`, or use the settings there as additions to
   your own filetype plug-in.


(2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive `vim-support.zip` mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory `$HOME/vimfiles/`
(find the value of `$HOME` with `:echo $HOME` from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in `$HOME/vimfiles/vim-support/templates/` if you
   have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive `vim-support.zip` to `$HOME/vimfiles` and run

      unzip vim-support.zip

   Afterwards, these files should exist:

      $HOME/vimfiles/autoload/mmtemplates/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/doc/...
      $HOME/vimfiles/plugin/vim-support.vim

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. Create one if there
   is none or use the file in `$HOME/vimfiles/vim-support/rc` as a starting point.

(2.3) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.4) Set at least some personal details. Use the map \ntw inside a Vim buffer
   or the menu entry:

      Vim -> Snippets -> template setup wizard

   It will help you set up the file `_runtimepath_/templates/personal.templates`.
   The file is read by all plug-ins supporting this feature to get your personal
   details. Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

      SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',       'Wolfgang Mehner' )
      SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',    'WM' )
      SetMacro( 'EMAIL',        'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
      SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',    'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   Use the file `$HOME/vimfiles/templates/vim.templates` to customize or add to
   your Vim template library. It can also be set up via the wizard.

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation.)

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file `$HOME/_vimrc`. The files
   `customization.vimrc` and `customization.gvimrc` are replacements or
   extensions for your `_vimrc` and `_gvimrc`. You may want to use parts of
   them. The files are documented.

   Some settings are specifically for VimScript buffers and should be placed in
   the filetype plug-in. You may copy the file `vim-support/rc/vim.vim` into the
   directory `$HOME/vimfiles/ftplugin/`, or use the settings there as additions
   to your own filetype plug-in.


(3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of the extendible template library
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  using additional plugins

Actions differ for different modes. Please read the documentation:

      :help vimsupport

Any problems? See the TROUBLESHOOTING section at the end of the help file
`doc/vimsupport.txt`.
