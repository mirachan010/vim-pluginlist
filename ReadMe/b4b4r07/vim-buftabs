This is a simple script that shows a tabs-like list of buffers in the bottom of the window. The biggest advantage of this script over various others is that it does not take any lines away from your terminal, leaving more space for the document you're editing. The tabs are only visible when you need them - when you are switchin between buffers.

# Features

* Can manage the some buffers at a statusline.
* Do NOT need some commands to display buffers such as `:ls` and `:buffers`.
* Can display a full path.
* Highlight support active or inactive buffers.

# Commands

Toggles the buftabs on and off.

	:BuftabsToggle

Enables the buftabs for the current buffer and any other buffer upon entering it.

	:BuftabsEnable

Disables the buftabs for the current buffer and any other buffer upon entering it.

	:BuftabsDisable

# Options
