# qfhist.vim

This plugin saves quickfix and location-list histories.<br/>
So you can invoke old histories of quickfix and location-list
without searching again.


Vim has already similar built-in feature, `:colder`, `:cnewer`.<br/>
But this plugin can narrow down by also `w:quickfix_title`
at command-line, unite.vim interface.
